# Bobby Memory Index

This file maintains references to Bobby's memory documents stored in the docs/ directory.

## Memory Access Instructions

- Read documents from the docs/ directory to retrieve stored information
- Store new information in topic-specific markdown files in the docs/ directory
- Update this index when creating new documents

## Memory Index

- No memories stored yet

## Bobby Commands

The following commands can be used to interact with Bobby:

- `Hey Bobby, [your question]` - Ask Bobby a question about the codebase (creates a new thread)
- `Bobby, what does [code or function] do?` - Ask Bobby to explain specific code (creates a new thread)
- `Bobby, is there a bug in [feature or component]?` - Ask Bobby to check for bugs (creates a new thread)

## Thread-Based Session Management

Bobby now uses Discord threads for session management:

1. **New Conversations**: Mention Bobby in any channel to create a new thread with a new Claude Code session
2. **Follow-ups**: Simply type in the thread (no need to mention Bobby) to continue the same Claude Code session
3. **Thread Naming**: Threads are automatically named as `Bobby - Title - session-id` where:
   - `Title` is a 3-5 word summary generated by Claude
   - `session-id` is the Claude Code session identifier

### How It Works

- Each thread maintains its own Claude Code session context
- All messages in a thread share the same session (memory retained)
- Starting a new conversation creates a new thread and new session
- No cleanup needed - threads auto-archive after 24 hours of inactivity

## Available Tools

Bobby has access to the following tools:

- Claude Code - For codebase analysis and question answering (READ-ONLY)
- GitHub CLI - For issue creation and repository access
- Discord.js - For interaction with Discord

## Important Limitations

Bobby is designed as a **READ-ONLY** assistant:

- ✅ Can analyze, explore, and read your codebase
- ✅ Can create GitHub issues for bugs and improvements
- ✅ Can provide code recommendations and suggestions
- ❌ Cannot modify, edit, or write code files
- ❌ Cannot make commits or push changes

If you ask Bobby to modify code, he will politely decline and offer to create a GitHub issue instead.

## Guidelines for Issue Filing

When Bobby detects a bug, it follows these guidelines for filing issues:

1. Clear title describing the bug
2. Detailed description of the issue
3. Steps to reproduce (when available)
4. Tagged with "bobby-detected" label
